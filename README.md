Treehouse Techdegree Project 3: Build an Interactive Form

This is the third project in the Treehouse Techdegree program. The goal is to use add interactivity to the form found in the helper HTML and CSS files supplied by Treehouse. When invalid information is entered, error messages are displayed to the user. 

The project makes use of jQuery. The principle of unobtrusive JavaScript is applied.

The rubric for this assignment includes:
Focus on the first field: Make the cursor focus on the "Name" input field so the user can immediately start typing

Job role selection: A text field appears when user selects "Other" under "Job Role" menu

T-Shirt section: The color menu responds to the user's choice of t-shirt theme. Before a theme is selected from the "Design" menu, no color is selected.

Activity registration: Validate form so that user can't select two activities happening at the same time. Also, the total cost of the activities are calculated and displayed automatically below the activities.

Displaying payment sections: Only the selected payment option appears.

Form Validation: Stop form from submitting until "Name" input field is not blank, email field contains a valid email, at least one activity is selected, and if a credit card is selected, the details should conform to credit card standards (13-16 digit card number, 5 digit zip, 3 digit CVV).

Form Validation Messages: When submitted, the form displays a message for each field that needs validation.

Form Works Without Javascript:
